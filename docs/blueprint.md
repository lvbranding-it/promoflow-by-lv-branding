## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep crimson (#8E0141), conveying a sense of energy, passion and excitement, especially associated with promotions.
- Background color: Light pink (#F5E7EB), a softer shade that doesn't detract from the deeper crimson, creating a smooth visual hierarchy and highlighting the primary actions.
- Accent color: Vivid coral (#FF8F73) provides an additional burst of attention, analogous to red but lighter and more playful, useful for drawing attention to new options.
- Headline font: 'Playfair', a modern serif that creates an elegant, fashionable, high-end feel.
- Body font: 'PT Sans' to complement 'Playfair'; a humanist sans-serif for clear and accessible body text.
- Use clean, modern icons representing discounts, rewards, and campaign elements.
- Subtle, smooth transitions and animations for reward reveals and inventory updates.
